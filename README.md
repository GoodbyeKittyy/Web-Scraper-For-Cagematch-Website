Hi there! Thank you for stopping by :)<br><br>



This project is a fully functional Excel Macro Enabled file capable of web scrapping any match list page from CageMatch, an online professional wrestling database.<br><br>



I am a very big professional wrestling fan and I made this tool a few years ago because I found all such match database websites don't have a sort function and you have to go through multiple links to get all the information. In fact, it's now 2024 and you still can't sort their lists and have to get the information from all the individual links on your own.<br><br>



1. Copy the link of the matchguide list you want to extract the data from. For example: https://www.cagematch.net/?id=8&nr=1&page=7

<br><br>




2. Paste the link into cell B2 and press the "Extract Web Data" button.

3. Depending on how large the list is, it could take a while. What it will do is go through every entry on every page and extract the information from all the links that have a rating of 8.00 or above. 
Ratings System:
" >= 9.5 , Black Fill and Gold Font
" >= 8.5 & < 9.5 , Gold Fill and Black Font
" >=8.00 & <9.5 , Blue Fill and Black Font
